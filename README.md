# Introduction

I never had a formal learning experience when it came to C, my university kinda just threw us into the deep end.
Thus resulting in me picking up bad habits. I'm hoping going over the C book in conjunction with doing https://github.com/thesecretlifeofabunny/DesignPatterns
helps me become a more rounded out developer.

I never got good at cmake, never got good at gcc, never good good at builds.

Barely touched malloc.

But surprisingly I was able to do async / parallel programming in C for a systems course perfectly fine.

Time to get better though at the foundations, and I'm never emberassed to learn.

Also good way to get better at nix.

My dev setup for c is gonna be NixOS (unstable branch) with helix and https://helix-editor.com/ using clangd as my lsp with lldb-dap
as a debugger if need. I may run some code in clion from time to time to see what jetbrains says about my code too, but only once my code is complete.
